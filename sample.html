<p>A snapshot overview of schools in Brunei that are considered (although not necessarily chosen) by English-speaking expat parents.</p>

<p>If there is no ribbon, pending or otherwise, it means we are aware of the school but have elected not to review it at this time. This could be for a number of reasons, but we continually update information and add or remove reviews as deemed appropriate.</p>

<p>Schools selected for full GSGI review are noted with <img src="https://gsg-61ea.kxcdn.com/media/contents/9_gsgi%20school%20banner.gif" style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px none rgb(160, 36, 53); vertical-align: middle;" /> next to their names.</p>

<p><i>By full GSGI review, we mean the school write-ups that are completely selected, researched, visited and written by our own editors. Our final write-ups take the good with the bad, warts and all, but we look for a preponderance of good before we drill down for in-depth details descend on the school for an exhaustive visit.</i></p>
